    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hot spinach dip doesn't contain mayo or sour cream like most, so it's very cheesy and very delicious. I get asked for the recipe every time I make it. For those who don't want a strong cheese like Cheddar, you can replace it with anything you like or even leave it out altogether. I like adding the Cheddar because it adds color and a little more flavor.</p>
